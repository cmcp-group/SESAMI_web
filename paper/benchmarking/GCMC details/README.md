1. The CIF files used for the GCMC simulations are included in the CIF_files/ folder. MIL-53_Al.cif is from CCDC database (DI: DOYBEA, solvent has been removed). MOF-808.cif, NU-1000.cif, NU-1200.cif, NU-1500-Fe.cif, and SIFSIX-3-Ni.cif are also from the CCDC. MIL-100_Fe.cif is from CoRE-MOF 2014 database. The other CIF files (Cu-BTC.cif, IRMOF-1.cif, MgMOF-74_opt.cif, MIL-100.cif, MIL-101.cif, UIO-66.cif, and ZIF-8.cif) are from RASPA directory.

2. The GCMC isotherms data is included in isotherm_data/ folder. The organized isotherms data, structure list, and the simulation details are included in isotherm_data_1.xlsx and isotherm_data_2.xlsx.
