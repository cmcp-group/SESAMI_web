The SESAMI web routines are benchmarked against other software, namely BETSI, pyGAPS, and BEaTmap.

Over a set of 14 MOFs, GCMC and experimental isotherms are used to generate surface area predictions.
Zeo++ surface area predictions are also generated with CIF files of the 13 MOFs with good GCMC isotherms.
