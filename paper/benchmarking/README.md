The SESAMI web routines are benchmarked against other software, namely BETSI, pyGAPS, and BEaTmap.

Over a set of 14 MOFs, GCMC and experimental isotherms are used to generate surface area predictions.
Zeo++ surface area predictions are also generated with CIF files of the 13 MOFs with good GCMC isotherms.

Cu-BTC is the same as HKUST-1 in these folders.

Note: In the benchmarking of the [JOSS paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05429), an [older version of BETSI](https://github.com/nakulrampal/betsi-gui/tree/89b3ec7a216084d4bb6e2963918c781f32810190) was used. The [newer version](https://github.com/nakulrampal/betsi-gui/tree/e68e3def588ef46116ce32677cdf51401f261701) has implemented bug fixes and makes successful predictions where the previous version did not. The updated BETSI results, corresponding to Tables 1-3 of the paper, are [here](/paper/benchmarking/new_BETSI_benchmark.xlsx) and [here](/paper/benchmarking/new_BETSI_updated_tables.pdf).
